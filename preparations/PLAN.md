# The plan: v2, verisectorium's template, and ASF as the first store

*Status: working plan, 2026-11-04. Written by councils-46 (Claude Opus 5.5) from a day's dialog with Joseph, then revised against two outside reads: `research/knowledge-graphs.md`, and `research/plan-review-1.md`, a de novo review by a fresh Fable agent of the version at `6b90d14`. **Proposed throughout**, except what is quoted from Joseph, which is his.*

*It replaces, as the place where the plan lives:*
- *`asf-earlier-vsect/KERNEL.md` (draft 3) and `vsect-lexicon.md`;*
- *`~/src/verisectorium/SCRATCH-for-joseph.md` §§1–7;*
- *the ASF system model, iterations 1–2 (`asf-system/`). That was a flow sketch, not a definition. Its renderer is kept as a smoke test.*

*`verisectorium-review/recommendation.md` stays the list of what to promote from the prior incarnation.*

*How to read it:*
- *Part A is the model as we now understand it, built from the primitives in A0.*
- *Part B is who owns what.*
- *Part C is the steps.*
- *Part D lists the assumptions and open questions, so none of them hardens silently.*

*A8 records where outside reads came from and what is still unverified. Their content has been moved into the sections it changes, so the plan has one current answer per question.*

*RC1 means `~/src/verisectorium/.archive/prior-incarnation/theory/influx/segments-model-rc1/`, the epistemic core this builds on. Read it whole before arguing with Part A.*

*Every number from the sprint carries its measurement condition. Two of them changed meaning once their conditions were restored (A2, A5).*

---

## Part A: The model

### A0. The primitives everything is built from

- **Truth claim.** An assertion. Its evidence reaches *positions* on RC1's `evidence/*` ladders, recording what has been done to it, and its **credence**, P(true), is derived from that evidence (A2). Refutation and lapse lower both.
- **Decision.** A choice at a branch point. Its standing is its **backing** (RC1's `decision/*`: grounds, consultation, accountability, falsifiers) and the importance it was made at, *for* a target.
- **Attested fact.** Asserted and checkable, but carried without a trail: agent ids, dates, the steward at the time. This is the floor where recursion stops. RC1 08 says what the floor rests on, in three layers:
  - **reproducibility,** the main defense against fabrication, wherever a check can be re-run;
  - **tamper-evidence** around the trail;
  - **identity** at the substrate's grain.

  Below those is named trust.
- **Attribute.** A deterministic measurement with no standing at all: a formula, and the moment it was computed.

**Everything else is composed of these:**
- an aspect's value is a truth claim ("this section is stale", "this result is novel"), a decision ("treat it as provisional for now"), or both;
- importance is an attribute (reach, for a target) plus a decision (the stakes);
- a composite's coherence is a truth claim about the whole;
- a rule is a decision whose application is computed.

**Four quantities, kept apart** (refined after Joseph's questions about what "certainty on a ladder" can mean, and after review 1 §1.1). Each is consumed differently, and a guard names which one it reads:

| Quantity | What it is | Form | A guard on it reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| **position** | where a record stands on a ladder: what has been done, e.g. an independent re-derivation bound to this version | a fact, computed from the trail | `position ≥ re-derived` (deterministic) |
| **credence of a truth claim** | P(true) | one number in [0, 1], derived (A2) | `P(true) ≥ 0.9` |
| **judged value** | where the truth lies on an aspect's value scale ("novelty: high") | a distribution over that scale | `P(value ≥ high) ≥ 0.8` |
| **forecast** | what a re-check would find after a lapse | a distribution over the ladder | *never a standing guard.* It only orders and holds work: what to re-check first; what an episode may hold rather than re-settle |

**Distributions over a scale behave according to the scale:**
- **Unordered set:** a probability per category. Concentration is all that matters; there is no near miss.
- **Ordered scale:** being one step off is less wrong than three. The meaningful statements are cumulative ("at least high, with probability 0.8"), and guards on judged values are written that way.
- **The label shown is a summary** (the mode or median).
- **The number of steps matters.** Maximum uncertainty is one bit on two steps and about 2.6 bits on six, so scalar "certainties" can't be compared across scales of different sizes.
- **Scales are bounded,** so at the ends mass spreads only one way. Cumulative statements handle that correctly; averages don't, and shouldn't be used.

**A judge's stated confidence is testimony, not the credence** (review 1 §1.2). When X writes `novelty: high`, together with "about 40% sure", that is an attested fact about X. The system's credence in the value is *computed* from it, with a judge-specific likelihood ratio that calibration estimates (A2, A7). Examples, with value, basis and credence written separately:
- `novelty: high` · basis: decided, by X, in passing, X stating 0.4 · credence: computed from X's statement and X's record.
- `novelty: high` · basis: decided, by Y, after a literature search, Y stating 0.8 · credence: computed likewise. The basis (a search, or none) is read by the projection, not by the judge.
- `relative freshness: stale` · basis: rule `freshness@v3` over the attribute recency · position: the rule fired, which is a fact. Whether the rule measures freshness well is a separate decision, with its own backing.

**Nothing is inferred from anything else.** No credence is inferred from the value, the basis or the graduation level, and a value never stands in for its credence, just as RC1's substitution law keeps one dimension from standing in for another. Graduation (A2) is about how a value is produced. Position is about what has been done. Credence is about how strongly it is believed.

### A1. Records, identity, composites

- **A record is the unit with one fate:** anything that can be refuted, superseded or ratified while its neighbors carry on. It is RC1's record, the archived design's statement, and the kernel drafts' "atom": one thing under three names. **Record** is the word here.
- **Identity is a maintained binding, not a filename** (RC1 11).
  - A name is a label with a history. A rename is an event, and old names keep resolving.
  - A record's manifestation (a file, a section, a span) is not its identity.
  - The old-slug → fate mapping is a projection over rename events.
  - **A changed meaning gets a new identifier** (the OBO rule, from the knowledge-graphs read). A rewording keeps the record; a redefinition is a new record, linked by `supersedes`.
- **A composite is a record in its own right** (RC1's *reify*). A segment, as ASF knows it, is the case Joseph described: sections laddered separately, possibly under different rules, which make sense only together.
  - Its **basis** is its sections, plus the neighbors it declares.
  - It has an aspect of its own, **coherence**: does this hold together, read as a whole? A whole-document review moves it.
  - **Checks bind to what they directly read** (B; from build systems, via the knowledge-graphs read). So a coherence review lapses when something *it read* changes. If it read a section's text, an edit to that text lapses it. If it read a section's standing, a change of standing does. This answers what was open question 1 in the same terms as every other check.
  - **Ratifying a section can be guarded on its composite's coherence holding at current versions.** That is "one change forces a look at the whole, and its neighbors, before ratification", expressed as a lapse and a guard. The sections stay separate records.
- **Three graphs, not one** (review 1 §2.8, with live_docs' two-graph split, A8):
  - **The navigational hierarchy is a tree:** statements → segment → chapters and appendices → parts → volumes → the theory. Each level is a composite with its own coherence. Membership doesn't propagate truth.
  - **The support web** (`supports`, premise dependencies) **is acyclic at statement grain.** A cycle found there is a grain defect or a mistyped edge, routed to that repair (D). Line B measured this on the five roots: a definition resting on a scope that rests on it is a cycle at segment grain and none at statement grain.
  - **Narration and cross-cutting groups** (`narrates`; notation groups; arrangements) run in any direction. An introduction narrates later segments: its *freshness* depends on them, but its truth neither supports theirs nor rests on it.
- **A dependency carries a predicate** on one of A0's quantities: on content alone; on position (`#x at position ≥ re-derived`); or on credence (`P(#x true) ≥ 0.9`). Never on a bare label.
- **Upward lapse in the hierarchy is a declared rule.** It is not automatic. A segment's coherence lapsing lapses its chapter's coherence only where the chapter's review read it: say, only when the segment's headline claim changed, or its credence crossed a band. Without that, every edit would lapse the whole theory.
- **Composition has three honest shapes, plus one exemption** (RC1 03 and 11):
  - **reify:** a composite becomes a record, as above;
  - **cluster:** typed parts under one identity, each with its own write rules (body, working notes, events, companions);
  - **arrangement:** an ordering that adds no claims, such as an outline or a segment's section order. It is authored, so it is a record, but it carries no warrant of its own;
  - **exempt, visibly:** archives, staging.

  The named pathology is the undeclared mixed composite: part claim, part decision, part history.
- **The specimen that makes this concrete:** `def-agent-environment`'s Working Notes hold six different fates under one heading: proposed teaching, proposed body text, open questions, reader confusions, figure ideas, and material belonging elsewhere. Each would be moved by a different mover (`SCRATCH-for-joseph.md` §3 has the table).

### A2. Standing: what moves, and what sustains it

**What a change does to standing** (revised after Joseph's corrections):
- **A content change lowers standing automatically.** Every check that *read* what changed lapses. The record's position drops and its credence is recomputed until something re-establishes them. That one act opens both sides of adjudication at once:
  - is the new content right?
  - does it still earn what it claims?
- **Adjudication is usually what *finds* a mismatch, not what starts from one.** A check, a review or a coherence read discovers that claimed and established standing have come apart, or that they haven't.
- **There is only ever one current epistemic label.** A record can't say "used to be exact, held with high credence" beside its present state; its history is a function of the log. So "no softened ghost" isn't a discipline agents must remember. v2 makes it impossible to get wrong.

**One common case: a defect found in a claim.** It runs in two phases, inside one episode:
1. **Honest intermediate.** The claim, or its credence, is lowered at once to what is now true ("no longer exact; conditional on X"). Downstream records that rest on it are notified, but the episode *holds* their re-stabilization. Re-settling everything around a lowered value that may be raised again shortly wastes the most cycles where the most rests on it.
2. **The strengthening attempt.** A spike works every angle for what *would* keep the earlier value true. It often finds more:
   - a way above where it was;
   - or the same value with less uncertainty.

   Those ripples are the welcome kind. When no strengthening exists, the spike can often mint a no-go that illuminates something central. That is a result too, and it ripples as part of the same changeset.

Securing and revising are the two halves of **strengthen**. Lowering the claim is **soften**, and it comes last.

**This is one scenario, not a taxonomy of adjudication.** Others include fidelity corrections, coherence repairs, notational changes, reordering prerequisites to resolve a chapter's incoherence, crossings, ratifications and importance assignments. The kinds of adjudication should come from cases like this one, each with its specimen, not from a list drawn up in advance.

**Aspects are values on a record, sorted by what sustains them.** This is Joseph's sort, one step more abstract than RC1's sort by what falsifies:
- **evidenced:** a truth claim, with credence derived from the positions its evidence reaches on RC1's `evidence/*` lines (derivation, in-vivo, wild-empirical, instance, testimony, carriage);
- **decided:** at a branch point, on a basis, by accountable parties. RC1's `decision/*`;
- **attested:** the floor (A0).

Many aspects mix these. A warrant is itself a truth claim, with a credence.

**Credence is computed by a declared weight-of-evidence projection.** Never typed.

Each evidence event records:
- its line;
- its rung;
- its outcome;
- its criterion, and whether that was committed before the outcome was seen;
- who did it, and what they had read.

The form is weight of evidence in Good's and Turing's sense: log-likelihood ratios that add, *where evidence is independent*. How events combine:
- **Independent evidence adds; dependent evidence counts once.** RC1's coherence default: agreement adds weight only to the degree descent is shown cut. Within one line of descent, only the strongest item counts. That is the *conservative bound* (the perfect-dependence limit, review 1 §1.4), the default when independence isn't shown, not a law of evidence.
- **Confirmations accumulate; refutations cap.** A rebut caps the claim, which becomes a no-go. It is not a large negative weight, so confirmations can't pile up against a refutation. The rule is lexicographic, not one algebra.
- **"Narrowed" is a new claim.** A narrowing changes the truth conditions. The result is a new version, or a new record under the OBO rule, with its own evidence: RC1 04's scope-bound.
- **Some contributions count as zero.** A check whose criterion was set after the outcome is excluded, by the commitment law. Self-checks carry a likelihood ratio of about 1. The evidence for that is a contrast: 116 self-checks found nothing on text that independent checks found defective about 42% of the time.

**Likelihood ratios are estimated from the trail, and kept apart from priors.** A claim's prior is a separate quantity; keeping the two apart is the point of the canon's `form-evidence-ledger` and of relata's shipped scheme. What a likelihood ratio needs, and what the trail must supply for it:
- **A check's error rates,** not its finding rate. "A first independent check finds something about 42% of the time" (65 of 153, independent re-derivations on sprint text) is a finding rate.
- **Error rates without ground truth need repeated, independent checks of the same version** (Dawid–Skene, 1979; review 1 §1.5). It is a latent-class model, identifiable only when some items carry **three or more conditionally independent checks on the same version**. With two checks on a binary truth there are 5 unknowns and only 3 observable agreement rates; with three, 7 and 7. The sprint checked successive versions, which are different items, and one independent check per landing gives it nothing to fit. **So the trail must include a calibration subpopulation:** a sample of versions that each get three independent checks, with the extra checks costed as calibration, not securing. Without it, likelihood ratios stay estimates.
- **Checkers must err independently given the truth.** Primed checkers inflate estimated accuracy. `seeded-by` edges and recorded provenance reads are what let them be excluded or modeled.
- **Use an ordinal variant, not the nominal original.** The 1979 model uses a full confusion matrix per checker, which a small trail can't fit on 4–6 rungs. An ordinal variant can (shared cutpoints, or one accuracy parameter with distance-weighted errors).
- **A calibration update is an era.** Re-estimating a likelihood ratio changes every credence that used it, in either direction, with no act on those records. So each calibration is recorded as an era ("computed under calibration c₃"), and the change is an event, not drift (RC1's ERA object; review 1 §1.6).

Several unread pieces of prior work bear directly on this; read them before designing the projection:
- the canon row `form-evidence-ledger`;
- relata's verification scheme;
- `theory/influx/synthesis/relata-methods-for-verisectorium-2026-08-05.md`.

**Derived credence: what premises do to the claims that rest on them.**
- **A claim needing several premises can be no more credible than all of them holding together.** This deliberately supersedes Joseph's earlier weakest-link phrasing ("the overall never exceeding the uncertainty of the weakest part of the chain", 2026-11-03), which is too generous.
- *Specimen (Joseph, 2026-11-04):* a proposition needs five upstream findings, each with P(true) ≈ 0.9. All five hold with probability:
  - 0.9⁵ ≈ 0.59 if they are independent;
  - between 1 − 5 × 0.1 = 0.5 and 0.9 if their dependence is unknown (the Fréchet bounds);
  - toward 0.9 if they are positively dependent.

  The downstream proposition sits below its premises until they tighten.
- **Independence works in opposite directions here and in evidence** (review 1 §1.3). Shown independence lets corroborating evidence *add*. For premises, shown independence *lowers* the conjunction from the min toward the product.
- **Premises in a theory are usually positively dependent:** they share definitions and constructions. So "independence recorded" will rarely be the honest record for a premise set. **The projection serves the interval when dependence is unknown,** not a point.
- **Credence attenuates with depth.** 0.95²⁰ ≈ 0.36; 0.99²⁰ ≈ 0.82. ASF's roots reach about 245 segments (transitive `depends:`, segment grain, at the sprint tag). So either per-link credence for re-derived mathematics is 0.99 or better, or the far corners of the theory will compute low, honestly. RC1 06's "support chains attenuate" is this, literally.
- **The derivation step is part of the composition.** P(conclusion) needs the premises *and* the record's own derivation to be valid. The operator combining own-line evidence with inherited premise credence is not yet designed (D).

**After a content change:**
- **Position drops deterministically** for the checks that read the changed text.
- **A redefinition is a new record:** no evidence carries over, and there is no forecast.
- **A rewording has a forecast** of what a re-check would find. Its calibration is open. The old figure, "3 real changes in 120 lapses", measured vsect 0.1's *transitive* lapse rule: 117 of the 120 were checks that never read the changed text. Under direct-read binding those never lapse. Among checks that did read it, the measured rate is at least 3 of 23 (13%), and plausibly higher (review 1 §1.7). The forecast orders re-checks; it never stands in for position.
- **Credence changes propagate by recomputation, not by events** ("notify, don't cascade"). That distinction is about what gets *recorded*, not about reach. A root's credence is a multiplier on everything below it, so a root falling from 0.95 to 0.80 can flip guards across the whole theory in one evaluation, with no event fired (review 1 §2.5). Band hysteresis is therefore load-bearing at the roots, not a nicety.

**Importance is an aspect, and always *for* a target:** a purpose, a decision, a consumer. Its basis is computed reach (what rests on this, for that target) plus decided stakes (how much that target matters). A record has no importance in general, only importance-for. **Use direct or weighted reach.** Transitive reach is about 245 for all five roots, so it can't rank them against each other.

**RC1's other dimensions, placed in this sort:**
- **Freshness:** mostly rule-driven over attributes.
- **Conviction:** evidenced; builds and tests.
- **Efficacy:** evidenced; recorded firings, possibly soft early on.
- **Fidelity:** attested at capture; corroboration is evidenced.
- **Comprehension:** starts soft, hardens through reader events.
- **Disposition:** mostly decided; it is routing.

RC1 says its set is incomplete. Importance and coherence are this plan's additions.

**Attributes are deterministic measurements, not aspects.** They come from three places:
- content: word count;
- the trail: age, recency, change heat, who has touched it;
- the graph: coupling, direct and weighted reach.

Each has a declared formula and is computed as of a moment. It has no warrant beyond that, and it never goes stale; only the aspects that use it lapse. Changing a formula is a system decision.

**Rules turn attributes into an aspect's bands.** For example, relative freshness = recency ÷ …, thresholded.
- A band crossing is a deterministic event that names the rule and its version: `{from: "fresh", to: "stale", by: <rule@version>}`.
- It ripples through `caused-by` into every aspect whose basis names this one.
- **This is where the flow model's "mechanical stations" belong:** they are rules in the definition, firing as events.
- **Hysteresis state must itself be derivable from the trail,** or standing stops being a function of the trail as of a moment (review 1 §2.4).

**Graduation: one ladder for every aspect *value*.**

| Level | What exists |
|---|---|
| 0. label | a value and who gave it |
| 1. ruled | produced under a declared rubric; the rubric is a record |
| 2. procedural | produced by a declared procedure whose runs are events bound to a basis; lapses when the basis changes |
| 3. reified | the aspect becomes a record of its own kind, with content (for novelty: near neighbors, search dates, the deliberations), the original subject as prerequisite, and aspects of its own |

Position and computed credence are procedural by construction. Only judged values graduate. At level 3, the new record's own aspects start again at level 0; that is the recursion. It stops in two places:
- **demand:** an aspect graduates only when its failures need their own repair, RC1's admission rule reused;
- **the attested floor.**

Hardness belongs to each value, not to each aspect type.

### A3. Decisions come in four kinds

They are separated by what they are about. Conflating them has happened repeatedly, the kernel drafts included.

| Kind | About | Examples | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **domain** | the subject itself | udon's syntax choices; vivarium's architecture; an ASF modeling choice | a record, with `decision/*` ladders; claims resting on it say so |
| **interior** | one record's state | keeping a label after a rewording; sending two spans of an influx file to a sink; declining to lift | an **event** on that record, bound to a version; not a record |
| **work** | where effort goes | "concentrate the spikes on this scope for now" | a routing fact with a target and usually an expiry |
| **system** | how the store works | admitting a kind; "slugs are free, publish a mapping" | an edit to the definition at stage 0; an admission later |

**The test,** asked of an outcome: if it went the other way, what would change?
- what ASF *asserts*: domain;
- only a record's state: interior;
- only what is worked on next: work;
- how the store works: system.

One deliberation often produces several kinds at once. Record each as what it is, linked by `caused-by`.

**Interior acts are escalated by importance, not by type.** A confirmation at a root needs more independence than at a leaf. The act's importance is its record's importance *for* what rests on it.

**A decision records its assumptions as edges** to the records they rest on. It lapses, as under-secured, when one of them changes or when its importance-for-target rises above what it was made at. Lapsing asks for the decision to be secured again; it doesn't reverse it.

### A4. Movers, and where councils fit

- **A transition is a mover.** It moves one named dimension of one kind along its ladder, through a named, signed channel. Refutation is a first-class result. A transition declares:
  - the dimension it moves;
  - its guard (which may read positions, credences, judged values and attributes, each named, per A0);
  - its evidence requirement;
  - what its close writes;
  - its decision-maker slot.
- **Who fills slots is decided later.** Joseph: *"treat each vsect transition-edge as a queue that is drained by a 'decision-maker' and not specify a council or agent etc."*; *"especially not initially."*
- **Kinds of mover, cheapest first:**
  - rules: deterministic band crossings and lapses;
  - single minds: securing acts, revisions, crossings;
  - councils.
- **Councils are for what is irreducibly judgment:**
  - decisions and ratification (`decision/*`);
  - a composite's coherence;
  - importance assignments, with their targets;
  - tensions;
  - reframing when an episode halts;
  - batch dispositions;
  - tribunals. A tribunal moves evidence: its close writes evidence plus a process decision.
- **A charter is derived from the transition it drains.** Joseph: *"the vsect type … will be developed hand-in-hand with what kind of council outcomes are meaningful for the record."* Its latitude depends on:
  - **the dimension moved,** which fixes what the close must write;
  - **importance-for-target,** which fixes the unity required. *"There is different level of unity required for different levels of importance."* An "object" blocks a close where unanimity is required, including on an epistemic label; a bike-shed can proceed over "object" but not over "strongly object";
  - **seats:** representative, where the body must be accountable; perspective (duck-typed); standing expert (re-forked, never substituted: a primary expert, adjacent experts, cross-cutting experts);
  - **tiers:** full member, discussant, preparer, consulted expert;
  - **non-response:** a unanimity council never shrinks;
  - **no confidence,** taken to a higher body;
  - **a meta-feedback channel** to the charter record;
  - **self-councils,** whose output is the agent's own decision.
- **The procedure** is `~/src/arch/msc/councils/generic-collab-council.md` (v2), Joseph's loop:
  - the topic presented without a solution;
  - a sealed expected solution held by the leader;
  - blind first responses, then shuffled second responses;
  - a unity report;
  - the finish form, with sustaining levels.

  The walking skeleton's lessons apply to whatever runs it: a seat is a lease with one holder; per-member state lives with the holder; rounds wait on submissions, never on deliveries.
- **Unity on importance can come before unity on truth.** Importance is itself decidable, and revisable.

### A4b. Change obligations: rules that ask questions

Most higher-order rules, and probably many lower-order ones at first, will act less like pass/fail guards and more like a business-rules engine that **generates obligations** for a proposed change. Assurance cases call these *defeaters*: identified doubts to eliminate (A8). They come in three forms:
- **Invariants to keep:** "this change must leave X unchanged."
- **Places to look:**
  - "Have you checked adjacent segments for this?"
  - "Are you sure this hasn't also changed such-and-such?"
  - "Does this Part I change require changing the SVG metaphor in the introduction?"
- **Ancillary evidence to gather before a decision.** For example, a preparer agent lists the non-adjacent segments that mention a term without depending on it. That list is a *description*-style reference (RC1 06, 11), evaluated at that moment.

How obligations work:
- They attach to the episode.
- Each is discharged by a recorded act: a check, a preparer's report, or a decision that it doesn't apply.
- The episode's commit guard, and any ratification of a composite's coherence, require them all discharged.
- **There is also room for doubts nobody has identified yet.** Confidence is never one number.
- **A warning from requirements tooling:** links flagged "suspect" tend to be cleared by habit (the knowledge-graphs read reports this from forums; unverified). So discharging an obligation should take an act that shows work, not a click.
- **A rule that generates obligations is itself a decision in the definition** (system kind). It graduates like an aspect: from a checklist line, to a rule with a matcher, to a procedure with its own record.

### A5. Global stability: episodes, ripple, and the breaker

- **"Stable" is moment-indexed.** A store is stable as of a moment when no rule would fire then, the clocks excluded, and nothing demands work (review 1 §2.7). Rules that read age keep any store from a timeless fixed point.
- **A perturbation opens an episode on a branch.** Perturbations include new audit findings, a new paper, a decision point reached, a new module.
  - The episode's scope starts at the perturbation's **direct-read reach** and grows as ripples land; the growth is itself a signal.
  - The affected subgraph is **unstable** while the episode is open.
  - **At a root, the scope is nearly the whole theory,** so root episodes overlap and run one at a time. Concurrency among episodes exists only away from the roots. That is what a changeset is for, and steps 3–5 should expect it (review 1 §2.6).
- **Inside the episode, in two passes** (the shape live_docs runs, A8):
  1. **Verdicts first.** A read-only walk collects, for every reachable neighbor: inconsequential, cascade, undercut, incompatible, or needs context. These are, or generate, the episode's obligations (A4b).
  2. **Then changes.** Rule-driven changes settle. The rest goes to the queues for minds and councils: checks, proposals, batch decisions, deeper cycles such as a spike. Discoveries outside the scope go to the general influx **carrying a condition** ("applies only if this changeset commits"), so an abort can't leave them acted on. Truth maintenance's assumption-labelled conclusions are the established form of this (A8, to verify).
- **The episode is the atomic changeset.** It ends one of three ways:
  - **commit:** every branch event is re-validated against main, every obligation is discharged, and the coherence of what it touched holds;
  - **abort:** nothing changes;
  - **halt.**

  This is RC1's open fork 6, EPISODE. The field trial, and live_docs' session-scoped trail with per-record history as a projection, are the evidence that the trail's primary grain is the episode. **SPECIMEN #3 decides it:** one edit to an ASF root segment, worked whole.
- **Convergence: yields fall and edit mass falls.** The measured yields are state-dependent. They fall by an order of magnitude with independence and with maturity: Part I's later rounds 2/17 → 0/16 → 0/8; pooled independent yield 0.57 on a first review falling to 0.18 by a fourth. So a constant-ρ branching process is the wrong model, and ρ < 1 is neither necessary nor sufficient. The criterion that matches the measurements: **findings per round fall, and edit mass per round falls.** Flat findings with growing text is the runaway loop. The sprint's segments grew 1.5–2.5×, and no round removed more than it added (review 1 §2.2).
- **The judgment loop's gain is near 1, and the land-only experiment decides it.**
  - As the sprint ran, about 1.3: 1.98 checks per version × 0.64 findings per check, *all* checks counted, × 1 version per finding.
  - Under one independent check per landing, about **0.75–1.2**, not the 0.6–0.8 this plan earlier carried. The 0.64 is diluted by 222 self-checks that found 3; per independent check the yield is 0.75–1.18 (review 1 §2.1).
  - What would move the gain: batching findings into one revision (fewer versions per finding), and maturity.

  The flow model (`foundations/asf-flows.md`) is an analysis over the trail, not part of the definition.
- **A breaker watches findings per kind, and edit mass, per generation.** It counts per kind, from `caused-by`, because raw counts fire on restatement churn while the mathematics holds. At counts of 2 or 3, "stopped shrinking" is close to noise, so the breaker **convenes a council; it never acts on its own.** The council's outcomes:
  - keep running, with a higher limit;
  - surgery: split the changeset;
  - reframe: a conflation of terms or a fused dimension, so split it;
  - a **tension record:** two well-supported states held, not oscillated between;
  - the definition itself is wrong ("Newton learning Relativity"). That opens a **system episode**: change the definition, then re-evaluate everything under it.

  Typed findings are a precondition, still owed: the sprint's 313 findings have no kind field.
- **Episodes whose scopes overlap** are merged, or one waits.

### A6. Intake, membranes, and what leaves

- **Nothing writes the population directly.** Joseph: *"AGENTS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO IN AND MANUALLY CHANGE CANON OR ATOMS. ONLY THROUGH VSECT!!!"* The canon's `form-influx-membrane` is the same law, written earlier.
- **Sources are cut into chunks.** RC1 and the kernel drafts call these "units". Each chunk has **exactly one current crossing**, to one of:
  - a state change on a record;
  - already present;
  - duplicate;
  - superseded;
  - rejected (the submitter erred);
  - needs-review (honestly unsure);
  - delivered elsewhere.

  **A crossing can be wrong.** A re-crossing that disagrees with an earlier one is evidence about the crosser, not the source (review 1 §3). A source retires when every chunk is terminal: the delete-test, computed.
- **Exploration state is recorded from the first act:** whether each source has been read, by whom, at which version, and how far each chunk has got. Unread is a query. The sprint's influx maps lacked this, and that is why it stopped.
- **Each legacy store gets a dialect declaration:** data saying what its files, frontmatter, tags and sections meant. ASF's `status:` is a hand-set word, so it arrives as testimony at the lowest rung. Intake is a mode of v2, needed for every older verisectorium.
- **Every store has designated influxes** (the realization model's triplet):
  - **canon,** with base material: "payload-sidecars with inferred items, one item per doc";
  - **lexicon;**
  - **SOP,** with the meta-feedback channel and the upgrade channel (`v2 reinit`);
  - plus a history layer.

  In ASF's case the SOPs may live as records of the system definition (Joseph's suggestion).
- **What leaves:** the canon's word is *efflux*. The name for deliveries into sibling stores is open, but it isn't "set aside", which is a sink word for a delivery.

### A7. Fitness, discrimination, calibration and value: analyses over the trail

- **Fitness aspects.** Readability, teachability, conciseness, coherence, coupling, novelty, impact. These are values on records or composites, with a basis and a credence like any aspect, often fed by attributes. They graduate like any aspect.
- **Kendall's τ measures discrimination, not calibration** (review 1 §1.8). τ compares two orderings of the same records. A claimant who orders everything correctly but is uniformly one rung overconfident gets τ = 1. Use τ-b, because ties dominate on short ladders, and declare where off-ladder terminals (refuted, not-proven) go. It fits:
  - **claimed against established ordering:** do the claims rank records the way the evidence does?
  - **importance against the order work was done:** drain order;
  - **reading order against dependency order:** each discordant pair is a forward reference;
  - **members' rankings, where a council produces rankings:** Kendall's W. Sustaining levels per option are a different object.
- **Calibration needs its own measures.** Does P(true) ≥ 0.9 hold 90% of the time? That takes reliability diagrams or a proper-score decomposition over recorded credences against later outcomes. This is what calibrates judges' likelihood ratios (A0) and check types' likelihood ratios (A2).
- **What to work on next: RC1 07's value of information,** not importance alone (review 1 §1.9). The worth of closing a gap is how likely the pending decision is wrong, times what that costs, times how much this measurement would change it. A per-ladder cost matrix (a re-derivation costs more than a confirmation) prices the measurement. A high-importance record with no decision waiting on it has little value of information. **The counterweight stays:** cheap truth is run, not triaged.

None of these is part of the definition.

### A8. Where outside reads came from, and what is still unverified

*Their content is now in the sections above. This section is provenance, not a second plan.*

- **`research/knowledge-graphs.md`** (a fresh agent, 2026-11-04). Graded per finding by its author.
  - **Truth maintenance** (Doyle 1979; de Kleer's ATMS 1986): status computed from recorded justifications; contradictions as *nogoods*; conclusions labelled by the assumption sets they hold under (A5's conditional discoveries). *Rests on abstracts, so verify at the primary first.*
  - **Fixpoints:** termination isn't uniqueness. Rule outputs must be monotone functions of their inputs, checkable by stratification. Odd loops oscillate; even loops are tensions (D).
  - **Build systems:** bind checks to direct reads, with early cutoff; transitivity is for notification only (RC1 06's own rule). Now in A1, A2 and B.
  - **Fusion:** copy-discounting (Dong et al. 2009) and subjective logic, as the established forms of the coherence default; Dawid–Skene (A2, with the identifiability condition from review 1).
  - **Assurance cases:** defeaters, and room for unidentified doubts (A4b).
  - **Knowledge graphs proper:**
    - one uniform statement shape for every aspect value from the start;
    - "unknown value" and "no value" as positive statements;
    - closed-world semantics for the trail, declared on export;
    - PROV and nanopublications for interchange, not as the engine;
    - the Stacks Project's permanent tags and the OBO rule (A1);
    - two clocks, when something happened and when it was recorded (B).
- **`theory/influx/verisect-and-ldocs.md`** (§§0–1 and 7–8 read). live_docs (Samuel Wecker) runs several pieces this plan only proposes:
  - a session-scoped write-ahead log as the episode, with per-document history materialized from it, and a close blocked until every revision-class change carries a reason;
  - a signed review after the fact, with proposed deltas: signer ≠ author; review decay on later edits; three missing event fields;
  - the two-pass cascade (A5);
  - navigation separate from dependency (A1);
  - the restated-ownership repair: collapse a copied enumeration to a link to its owner, cutting restatement churn at the source;
  - queues surfaced at session close.

  **One live_docs rule doesn't transfer:** "more than three documents from one edit is a smell" would fire on every ASF root edit, where the fan-out *is* the mathematics.
- **`research/plan-review-1.md`** (a fresh Fable agent, de novo, on `6b90d14`). Its findings are integrated throughout, cited by section. Two of them are the reviewer's, from training, and should be checked at a primary source before they shape the projection: Dawid–Skene's identifiability, and τ as rank concordance.
- **What the outside reads judged genuinely new here:**
  - the substitution law, as something checkable;
  - the commitment law;
  - independence recorded, not assumed;
  - importance always *for* a target;
  - under-recording treated as equal dishonesty.

## Part B: Who owns what

| Layer | Owns | Changed how, now |
|---|---|---|
| **verisectorium** (`~/src/verisectorium/`) | the general model: RC1, the theory canon, the template and seed records under one `TEMPLATE.outline.md` | by editing and verifying, the old way; v2 does not run on it yet |
| **v2** (engine and CLI) | invariants; the event log; the definition format; intake; projections and renderings; `init` / `reinit`; checks of the definition itself | by building it, slice by slice |
| **a store's definition** (ASF's, in aat-v3) | its kinds and their aspects, transitions, rules and attributes, dialect declarations | hand-written files at stage 0 |
| **the store** (ASF's records) | records, events, trails | only through v2 |

**What v2 keeps from the kernel drafts:**
- the engine is the only writer of records, and every file under the store is a rendering checked against the log;
- the log is append-only;
- **versions are hashes of the normalized form,** so a reflow or `md-press` unwrap doesn't mint a version;
- **a check binds to what it directly read,** and lapses with the cause named. Transitive reach is used for notification only;
- standing is computed, never typed;
- every event carries an attested actor: agent key, parent, type, session; or a tool at a version, the version being its era;
- **two clocks on every event:** when the act happened, and when it was recorded;
- an act the definition can't express is refused and recorded as a demand;
- every stock has an exit;
- the trail is closed-world: absence means unrun.

**What v2 defers:** the definition held as records. That is stage 2.

**Compiler stages:**
- **0, now:** hand-written definitions in two layers. The general layer is applied by `v2 init` and `v2 reinit` from verisectorium's template; the store's layer is ASF's files.
- **1:** v2 checks the definitions:
  - every kind answers the founding questions;
  - every transition names the dimension it moves;
  - the substitution law holds;
  - `supports` is acyclic at statement grain;
  - rule outputs are monotone in their inputs (stratified), so evaluation is order-invariant.
- **2:** the definitions become records, admitted through v2's own transitions. v2 may then run on verisectorium itself.

**What survives a blow-away of the backing store is the event log,** replayed under the new definition with a migration step wherever the schema changed. Hand migrations during stage 0 are recorded as migrations.

**Where the store lives:** outside the repo, by OS convention, as relata does (Joseph's decision in the preparations README). The repo is an exception, only "if it doesn't overly complicate … atomically coherent changesets". SPECIMEN #3 tests that default; it doesn't decide from scratch.

## Part C: Steps

1. **Promote into verisectorium's template and seed records** what `verisectorium-review/recommendation.md` lists:
   - RC1 whole;
   - the Aug-14 model's uncarried parts;
   - the 19 principle segments;
   - the realization model;
   - ORIENT;
   - the template's two enums;
   - the four layout-bound segments, re-cut (scratch §5).

   Then write `TEMPLATE.outline.md`.
2. **The influx inventory:** the whole source list from the sprint's maps (`asf-sprint-2026-10/influx-scout/`, `internal-surfaces/`), each source with its exploration state and who has and hasn't read it. This is separate from crossing anything.
3. **The smallest v2:**
   - the definition format;
   - the event log as primary, with two clocks;
   - `init` / `reinit`;
   - source and chunk with crossing outcomes and exploration state;
   - one record kind with its aspects;
   - direct-read binding.
4. **`v2 init` on aat-v3** with the verisectorium core only. Then ASF's dialect declaration, on paper, for Line B's five root segments: `def-agent-environment`, `def-action-transition`, `def-observation-function`, `def-chronica`, `scope-adaptive-system`.
5. **ASF's first hand-written definitions:** only what the five roots demand. Each gap becomes a recorded demand.
6. **Bring the five roots in as sources, cut them and cross them.** Then:
   - **SPECIMEN #3** (one root edit as an episode, run serially since it is a root);
   - **RC1 08's auditor walk;**
   - **a first calibration subpopulation:** a few versions given three independent checks each.

   Then a second slice, chosen by what the first one strained.

**The anchor rule, in both directions:**
- no ASF kind without a named specimen and a founding-question justification;
- no change to RC1 or the canon without an ASF specimen that demanded it, or a mark saying it is unexercised.

## Part D: Assumptions and open questions

**Assumptions, each with what would make us revisit it:**
- **The monotone rule.** Rule-driven changes to *standing* (positions, credences, judged values) may only lower, reset or flag; only recorded acts by minds raise them. It doesn't cover importance, which rises by rule when a dependent is added.
  - **What it buys is termination, not uniqueness.** Order-invariance, which RC1 requires, also needs rule outputs that are monotone functions of their inputs, checked by stratification at stage 1 (A8).
  - **Not an invariant** (Joseph): some deterministic quantities are in principled tension. Coupling and cohesion trade against each other, and finding their balance is a search for an equilibrium; a council adjudicating each half of an oscillation would be silly. The likely replacement is a deterministic equilibrium search run to its own convergence criterion inside an episode, recorded as one act.
  - **Revisit** when the first non-monotone rule is wanted on real material.
- **Hysteresis on bands,** with its state derived from the trail. **Revisit** if it hides real movement.
- **Councils move judgment-shaped dimensions.** They are not general decision-makers. **Revisit** if a transition needs a council for something that isn't judgment.
- **`supports` is acyclic at statement grain** (stage-1 lint; a found cycle is a grain defect or a mistyped edge). The credence projection is still declared as a least fixpoint, as a safety net. **Revisit** if a legitimate support cycle turns up on real material.

**Open questions:**
1. How a composite declares its neighbors.
2. Is the trail's primary grain the episode? (SPECIMEN #3.)
3. Claim records: one per statement, or one per claim within it?
4. ASF's `disc-*` and `impl-*` segments: teaching, recognitions, or arrangements?
5. The name for deliveries into sibling stores.
6. The operator combining a record's own derivation evidence with its premises' inherited credence (A2).
7. **The lexicon.** The kernel drafts' lexicon is superseded. Its replacement should be built as the template's lexicon store, not a free-standing file, from:
   - RC1's settled words: record, dimension (with namespace), line, mover, channel, ladder, rung, trail, projection, era, binding, dangle, collide, membrane, base material, delete-test, coherence default, commitment law;
   - this plan's: aspect, attribute, band, graduation, episode, composite, position, credence, judged value, forecast.
8. **The calibration budget:** how many versions get three independent checks, chosen how, and paid for as what.

## Appendix: discussed, but not in this plan

*Things that came up on 2026-11-03 and 11-04 and aren't carried above. Some are recorded elsewhere; some may only be floating in transcripts. Listed so they aren't silently lost.*

- **The steward's accountability and veto.** Joseph: *"I'll have ultimate veto power independently because in the eyes of the law and the world I shoulder full actual accountability and reputation for the outcomes."* How that relates to `decision/accountability` and to council closes is open.
- **A council's composition is part of its record:** the diversity of perspectives and underlying models, "in case there are questions about its outcomes later at a higher level."
- **In-meeting acts:**
  - a research subcommittee that reports back without interrupting the meeting;
  - adding a member with a needed perspective;
  - near-identical motions counting as seconds;
  - follow-up questions based on what others said.

  See the councils spikes and the collaborative council file.
- **Decision theory** (Joseph, 2026-11-03):
  - deciding under one regime, even arbitrarily, as the most effective way to gather evidence, with pilots as its routine form;
  - information, importance and decision space evolving together, and going wrong when conflated;
  - fiat by an accountable owner;
  - theorems conditioned on A and on B. The weakest-link part of this is superseded in A2.

  Verbatim in `foundations/research/dialog-for-kernel-2026-11-04.md`, window 1.
- **What a changeset gathers:** "all of the memories of other related/adjacent/historical things", draining several sources at once, possibly gathered by a specialist. What must fit in one mind is the intent, the invariant and the judgment calls (`foundations/asf-flows.md` §6).
- **The interface:** an `ant`-shaped request on stdin, with a structured result (kernel draft 3; the vsect lead's plan-read addendum).
- **Truth as the frame for councils:** unity of purpose, with members differing by experience, context, reasoning and angle, and divergence meaning adjudicating truth "from the perspective of the system they know most about." Also high-councils.
- **Reports as records:** v2's projections into the repo, "often recorded as curated collections of atoms". A report can be an arrangement.
